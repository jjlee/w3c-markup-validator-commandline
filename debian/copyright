Notes

   This version:
   http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231

   This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December
   31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that
   this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the
   W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references
   to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the
   ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the
   [24]previous version and is written so as to preserve the [25]Free
   Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and [26]OSI's
   certification under the [27]Open Source Definition.
