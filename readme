The command line version of the w3c validator is a heavily mangled
version of the original "check" CGI script by Gerald Oskoboiny. This
version does broadly the same job, although doesn't have all the
HTML niceties in it's output. It also doesn't have any HTML in the
code anymore ;-)

This program was originally a CGI/mod_perl program with extensive
mixing of HTML and functionality. It was subsequently severely
mangled by Ralph Bolton (http://www.coofercat.com) into a command
line version of the same program. It now performs no HTML work at
all, but has (hopefully) got machine readable output, so could
be used to create an online facility that validates pages.
There's no guarantee that this is the most efficient program in
the world. Indeed, we can easily see it's a bit of a mess, so
almost certainly isn't. However, short of a complete rewrite,
it'll do nicely for a lot of jobs. Those of a Perly disposition
will easily spot the original CGI script, and no doubt plenty
of room for improvement.
