<P>The following sections contain the formal SGML definition of
HTML 4.0, including the <A href="sgmldecl.html">SGML declaration
</A> and the <A href="dtd.html">Document Type Definition</A> (DTD),
as well as a <A href="#catalog">sample SGML catalog</A>.</P>

<H2><a name="h-20.1">20.1</a> Document Validation</H2>

<P>Many authors rely on a limited set of browsers to check on the
documents they produce, assuming that if the browsers can render
their documents they are valid. Unfortunately, this is a very
ineffective means of verifying a document's validity precisely
because browsers are designed to cope with invalid documents by
rendering them as well as they can to avoid frustrating users.</P>

<P>The following sample SGML catalog can be used with an SGML
parser, such as nsgmls (see <A href="../references.html#ref-SP">
[SP]</A>), to verify that HTML documents conform to the HTML 4.0
DTD. It assumes that the DTD has been saved as the file "HTML4.dtd"
and that the entities are in the files "HTMLlat1.ent",
"HTMLsymbol.ent" and "HTMLspecial.ent". Make sure your SGML parser
is capable of handling Unicode. See your validation tool
documentation for further details.</P>

<P>Beware that such validation, although useful and highly
recommended, does not guarantee that a document fully conforms to
the HTML 4.0 specification. This is because an SGML parser relies
solely on the given SGML DTD which does not express all aspects of
a valid HTML 4.0 document. Specifically, an SGML parser ensures
that the syntax, the structure, the list of elements and their
attributes are valid. But for instance, it cannot catch errors such
as setting the <a href="../struct/objects.html#adef-width-IMG"><SAMP class="ainst-IMG">width</SAMP></a> attribute of an
<a href="../struct/objects.html#edef-IMG"><SAMP class="einst">IMG</SAMP></a> element to an invalid value (i.e.,
"foo", "12.5", or "25%"). Although the specification restricts the
value for this attribute to an "integer representing a length in
pixels", the DTD only defines it to be <A href=
"../types.html#type-cdata">CDATA</A>, which actually allows any
value. Only a specialized program could capture the complete
specification of HTML 4.0.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, this type of validation is still highly
recommended since it permits the detection of a large set of errors
that make documents invalid.</P>

<H2><a name="h-20.2">20.2</a> <A name="catalog">Sample SGML catalog</A></H2>

<P>This catalog includes the override directive to ensure that
processing software such as nsgmls uses public identifiers in
preference to system identifiers. This means that users do not have to
be connected to the Web when retrieving URL-based system
identifiers.</P>
