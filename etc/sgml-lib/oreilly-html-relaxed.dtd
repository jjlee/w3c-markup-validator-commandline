        The O'Reilly HTML Extended DTD is an extension of the
        "recommended" interpretation of the HTML 2.0 DTD as defined in
        RFC 1866.  The extensions add the following popular features:

        + Tables

          The table model from the now defunct HTML 3.0 DTD has been
          used with the following modifications: the content model of
          <TD> has been extended to include text (non-block) elements
          and the type of the BORDER attribute has been changed to
          NUMBER in order to support changes to the border width.

          Note: In SGML, the validity of <TABLE BORDER> and 
          <TABLE BORDER=value> are mutually exclusive.  In order to support
          <TABLE BORDER=value> in this DTD, it is necessary to make
          <TABLE BORDER> invalid.  This makes the O'Reilly HTML
          Extended DTD backwards-incompatible with HTML 2.0.


        + Modification of browser background and colors through attributes
          on the <BODY> element.
        + Support for WIDTH and ALIGN attributes on HR.
        + Support for ALIGN=left and ALIGN=right on IMG.
        + Support for CLEAR attribute on BR.
        + Support for an ALIGN attribute on P.
        + Support for an ALIGN attribute on headings.
        + Support for the <FONT> element.
        + Support for the <CENTER> element.
        + Support for the additional entities: &copy; and &nbsp;.

        We use the following DOCTYPE to identify this DTD:

            <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//O'Reilly and Associates//DTD HTML Extended 1.0//EN">

        In addition, four external entities (files) are referenced by
        this DTD:

        1. PUBLIC "-//O'Reilly and Associates//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"

          The HTML DTD from RFC 1866 with a few slight modifications.

        2. PUBLIC "ISO 8879-1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN//HTML"

          The ISO Latin1 entities (referenced by the RFC 1866 DTD).

        3. PUBLIC "-//O'Reilly and Associates//ELEMENTS Table Fragment 1.0//EN"

          The table elements, extracted from the now defunct HTML 3.0 DTD,
          with the modifications noted above.

        4. PUBLIC "-//O'Reilly and Associates//ENTITIES Additional HTML 1.0//EN"

          Additional entity definitions.

        An appropriate SGML Open catalog file for this DTD is:
