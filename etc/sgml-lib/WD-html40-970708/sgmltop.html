<p>The following sections contain the formal SGML definition of HTML 4.0,
including the <a href="sgmldecl.html">SGML declaration</a> and the <a
href="dtd.html">Document Type Definition</a> (DTD), as well as a <a
href="#catalog">sample SGML catalog</a>.

<h2>Document Validation<a name="h-10.1">&nbsp;</a></h2>

<p>Many authors rely on a limited set of browsers to check on the
documents they produce, assuming that if the browsers can render their
documents they are valid. Unfortunately, this is a very ineffective
means of verifying a document's validity precisely because browsers
are designed to cope with invalid documents by rendering them as well
as they can to avoid frustrating users.

<p>The following sample SGML catalog can be used with an SGML parser, such
as nsgmls, to verify that HTML documents conform to the HTML 4.0 DTD. It
assumes that the DTD has been saved as the file "HTML4.dtd" and that the
entities are in the files "HTMLlat1.ent", "HTMLsymbol.ent" and
"HTMLspecial.ent". See your validation tool documentation for further
details.

<p>Beware that such validation, although useful and highly
recommended, does not guarantee that a document fully conforms to the
HTML 4.0 specification. This is because an SGML parser relies solely
on the given SGML DTD which does not express all aspects of a valid
HTML 4.0 document. Specifically, an SGML parser ensures that the
syntax, the structure, the list of elements and their attributes are
valid. But for instance, it cannot catch errors such as setting the
<samp class="ainst-IMG">width</samp> attribute of an <a href="../struct/includes.html#edef-IMG"><samp
class="einst">IMG</samp></a> element to an invalid value (i.e., "foo",
"12.5", or "25%"). Although the specification restricts the value for
this attribute to an "integer representing a length in pixels",
the DTD only defines it to be <a
href="../types.html#type-cdata">CDATA</a>, which actually allows any
value. Only a specialized program could capture the complete
specification of HTML 4.0.

<p>Nevertheless, this type of validation is still highly recommended
since it permits the detection of a large set of errors that make
documents invalid.
